# office


soon to be a portfolio of my successes (and failures) in learning  


## projects
[this website](/) - my fun exploration in having a website and public content. [notes on its evolution](website)  


[expensifly](https://github.com/forgxyz/expensifly) - a basic django webapp for recording my expenses. i use google sheets right now and figured i could do better. my aim is to build a portal i can access from my phone for a quick glance at my spending.  


## other undertakings
i am currently studying french with the goal of living there for 5-6 months in the first half of 2021. i have absolutely no background with the language as i took spanish in high school so it's a bit of a challenge. to practice, i will be writing *something* daily [here](french). do not expect high quality...  


## classes
[cs50x](/cs50x)  

[cs50w](/cs50w)  

[cs50ai](/cs50ai) - i started this course in the spring, but tbh it's hard to commit to extracurriculars during the summer. work got busy and the golf courses opened so the last thing i wanted to do was spend *more* time inside. i had been working on cs50w during the main april lockdown and needed a break. i plan to restart this over the fall / winter.
