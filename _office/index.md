## projects
[this website](/) - my fun exploration in having a website and public content. [notes on its progression](website)  

[expensifly](/expensifly) - a basic django webapp for recording my expenses. i use google sheets right now and figured i could do better. my aim is to build a portal i can access from my phone for a quick glance at spending & budgeting.  


## classes
everything highlighted on this page is due to the work i have done on the below classes. self-directed study is hard, but cs50 has built such a solid foundation that i feel i can learn just about anything. the below links lead to readme pages for each github repository, within which is my course work.  

[cs50x](/cs50x) - the catalyst needed to push my interest forward with a structured course. i had found cs50x back in early 2017. tried it, gave up. the last thing i wanted to do a few months after graduating college was take more classes. so, i waited a year and tried again in 2018. i got stuck on credit.c and looked for help.  
searching for an answer to a programming problem set when you're on your own is a terrible thing. i found answers that involved concepts so far out of reach i didn't even realize i was confused about the logic and not the implementation. i was also in the midst of finance and accounting courses evenings after work. i gave up. but, i never forgot.  
september 2019 rolled around and i gave myself an ultimatum. i *thought* i wanted to explore cs and learn python but if i started and gave up again, it was clearly not in the cards. i powered through. sure, i got stuck but i learned how to walk away - literally, taking apollo for a walk around the block is the ideal head clearer - and forget what i got stuck on so i could approach the problem from a new direction. taking this course was the best thing i could have done and failing to get thru it twice made victory a bit sweeter.  

[cs50w](/cs50w) - description pending  

[cs50ai](/cs50ai) - i started this course in the spring, but tbh it's hard to commit to extracurriculars during the summer. work got busy and the golf courses opened so the last thing i wanted to do was spend *more* time inside. planned restart: october
