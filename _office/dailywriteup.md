# learning french

in early 2021, i'll be going to france for 5-6 months. major problem - i know **zero** french. so, i've got duolingo, drops & rosetta stone on deck.  

*there will definitely be errors in the below. idc, i will not use google translate for anything here - simply relying on what i remember from studying... i have experience with spanish and german so there may be accidental crossover*
