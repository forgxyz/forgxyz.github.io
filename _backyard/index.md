# digital garden ...?

not quite sure, but i like the sound of it. i only just heard about digital gardens recently in [MIT Tech Review ](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/)... tbd  

maybe i'll use this for a [running list of random thoughts](thoughts)  

i am also still completely new to jekyll so the format will have to evolve over time. [follow that list of notes](/office/website), for whatever reason,
