personal_log: |
  Hey there! Iâ€™m Jack. I am a self-taught data engineer and builder, working at the intersection of blockchain and analytics. I'm endlessly curious and quick to tinker. I learn by doing, sometimes breaking things in the process. I push infrastructure and insight efforts forward at Flipside Crypto, where we turn raw onchain activity into usable, queryable intelligence for foundations, protocols, and power users enabled by an AI powered insights engine.  
    
  I build data pipelines, model blockchain behaviors, and experiment with AI to unlock new ways of interacting with data. I care a lot about making complex systems intuitive and actionable, whether it's for humans or agents.  
    
  Outside of work, I'm usually in the Colorado mountains: skiing tree lines, hiking with my dog, or chasing a dopamine spike on the squash court. I believe tools should make life easier and insights easier to share. I'm always learning, always shipping, and always looking out for new ways to grow.
