  Hey there! I'm Jack, a data professional who lives at the intersection of blockchain technology and analytics. 
  When I'm not diving deep into on-chain data or building data pipelines, you can find me exploring the Colorado 
  mountains with my dog, hitting the trails, or planning the next outdoor adventure. I believe in the power of 
  data to tell stories and drive decisions, especially in the rapidly evolving world of crypto and DeFi. I am an avid learner and always looking for new challenges and opportunities for growth.
  I am a self-taught developer with a mind for data and a passion for building tools that make life easier and insights accessible.
