  tech_stack: "Python, MCP"
  status: "DEVELOPMENT"
  description: >-
    A quick and dirty tool to estimate the token cost of a MCP tool call.
    Allows the user to configure an MCP server, call a tool, and run the response through the Anthropic `count_tokens` function to estimate the cost of the call.
    This tool aids in the development of the Flipside MCP tools by providing insight into the context consumed by respective tools.

- title: "Flipside Dashboard Evolution Toolkit"
  tech_stack: "Python, Claude, Context Engineering, MCP"
  status: "DEPLOYED"
  description: >-
    A toolkit for archiving Flipside dashboards and evolve them into LLM-generated artifacts.
    `dashboard-dl` allows analysts to download their queries, result sets, and visualization configurations to preserve their hard work.
    I then wrote a robust set of Cursor rules to guide the workflow of interpreting the archives into context, how to interact with the Flipside MCP toolkit, and how to build simple HTML-based pages to redeploy their work with new-age analytics tools.

- title: "dbt data-discovery Server"
  tech_stack: "Python, MCP, FastAPI"
  status: "DEPLOYED"
  description: >-
    A basic MCP server that retrieves dbt JSON artifacts from dbt projects deployed to GitHub for use in an LLM client. 
    This project has been forked to the FlipsideCrypto organization and taken private for production deployment. Recent changes on the production server include a refactor to be a REST API-first server using the FastAPI frameworkwith MCP wrapped around GET endpoints with the fastapi_mcp library.
    This API serves metadata about our data models to the internal ai-insights tool to enhance table selection and query generation by the LLM.
    See the linked repository for an MCP-only MVP of the project.

    Built and maintain data models for various blockchain in my work at Flipside. My primary focus is on Near, Bitcoin, Flow, and other various alternative Layer 1s, like Aptos, Stellar, Movement, etc.

  status: "ARCHIVED"
  description: >-
    Before joining Flipside full time, I was a solo data analyst building dashboards and reports for blockchain projects. An archive of my old work is available in the following link. Note: As of August 2025, Flipside has deprecated SQL studio and dashboard links will no longer work. I am considering archiving some of my older work for preservation.

- title: "Anchor Protocol Stats Dashboard"
  tech_stack: "SQL, dbt, Snowflake, Retool"
  status: "ARCHIVED"
  description: >-
    A dashboard for Anchor Protocol commissioned by the Anchor team to track deposits and collateral TVL in late 2021. I build the data models for this dashboard with bespoke dbt models prior to joining the Flipside data team. A member of the Flipside team granted me a Snowflake data share upon which to build my data models, as I had found discrepancies in the accuracy of the Anchor data that was being modeled by them at the time. Deposit yield was accrued without event emission, so I developed an estimation that tracked the actual amounts within 99% accuracy of what the Anchor team was reporting.

  tech_stack: "Python, Django, Heroku"
  status: "DEPRECATED"
  description: >-
    A personal budgeting tool built with Django and deployed to Heroku. This project was a learning experience in building a full-stack application with a database backend.
    The project was deprecated in favor of a more modern approach to personal budgeting.
