  tech_stack: "Python, MCP, FastAPI"
  status: "DEPLOYED"
  description: >-
    A basic MCP server that retrieves dbt JSON artifacts from dbt projects deployed to GitHub for use in an LLM client. 
    This project has been forked to the FlipsideCrypto organization and taken private for production deployment. Recent changes on the production server include a refactor to be a REST API-first server using the FastAPI frameworkwith MCP wrapped around GET endpoints with the fastapi_mcp library.
    This API serves metadata about our data models to the internal ai-insights tool to enhance table selection and query generation by the LLM.
    See the linked repository for an MCP-only MVP of the project.

  status: "COMPLETED"
  description: >-
    Winning team of the Flipside Crypto internal AI hackathon in January 2025. This project was a proof of concept for using LLMs to generate SQL queries to support non-technical users with answering data questions.
    My primary contibution was a data definition framework that allowed the system to understand the data models, how to use them, and the schema of the data.
    This project was a proof of concept that would later become the Flipside Growth MCP and the data-discovery service that I would later build to support it.
