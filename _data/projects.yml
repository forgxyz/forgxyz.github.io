- title: "dbt data-discovery Server"
  tech_stack: "Python, MCP, FastAPI"
  status: "DEPLOYED"
  description: >-
    A basic MCP server that retrieves dbt JSON artifacts from dbt projects deployed to GitHub for use in an LLM client. 
    This project has been forked to the FlipsideCrypto organization and taken private for production deployment. Recent changes on the production server include a refactor to be a REST API-first server using the FastAPI frameworkwith MCP wrapped around GET endpoints with the fastapi_mcp library.
    This API serves metadata about our data models to the internal ai-insights tool to enhance table selection and query generation by the LLM.
    See the linked repository for an MCP-only MVP of the project.

  tech_stack: "TypeScript, elizaOS framework"
  status: "DEVELOPMENT"
  description: >-
    Built a custom AI Agent using the elizaOS framework with Twitter and Telegram integration to listen for trends on Crypto Twitter and post tweets with data behind the narratives.
    Telegram integration allows for a more direct ask-and-answer experience.
    Integrated with various MCP servers to provide data access to the agent.

- title: "Internal AI Hackathon Winning Team"
  tech_stack: "Python, SQL, dbt"
  status: "COMPLETED"
  description: >-
    Winning team of the Flipside Crypto internal AI hackathon in January 2025. This project was a proof of concept for using LLMs to generate SQL queries to support non-technical users with answering data questions.
    My primary contibution was a data definition framework that allowed the system to understand the data models, how to use them, and the schema of the data.
    This project was a proof of concept that would later become the Flipside Growth MCP and the data-discovery service that I would later build to support it.

  status: "ARCHIVED"
  description: >-
    Before joining Flipside full time, I was a solo data analyst building dashboards and reports for blockchain projects. An archive of my old work is available in the following link. Note: As of August 2025, Flipside has deprecated SQL studio and dashboard links will no longer work. I am considering archiving some of my older work for preservation.

  tech_stack: "SQL, dbt, Snowflake, Retool"
  status: "ARCHIVED"
  description: >-
    A dashboard for Anchor Protocol commissioned by the Anchor team to track deposits and collateral TVL in late 2021. I build the data models for this dashboard with bespoke dbt models prior to joining the Flipside data team. A member of the Flipside team granted me a Snowflake data share upon which to build my data models, as I had found discrepancies in the accuracy of the Anchor data that was being modeled by them at the time. Deposit yield was accrued without event emission, so I developed an estimation that tracked the actual amounts within 99% accuracy of what the Anchor team was reporting.
