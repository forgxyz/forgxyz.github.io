<p>There‚Äôs a lot out there already written about what Wormhole is and how to use it. This isn‚Äôt going to be one of those articles. Two recent Flipside bounties asked the community analysts to investigate user behavior in the weeks since Wormhole was enabled for Terra. I really enjoyed those so I created a whole website just to write more about my work on those (and future) bounties.</p>

<h4 id="terra-bounties-101--103">Terra Bounties 101 &amp; 103</h4>

<p>As many of them often are, two recent Terra analytics bounties were closely inter-related. The primary question for 101 was a call to analyze initial user behavior with Wormhole v2, focusing on what they‚Äôre sending and to where. 103 honed in on UST, aka the Terra dollar. I‚Äôve loved analyzing UST - where it is, where it‚Äôs going, and how it‚Äôs being used (I‚Äôll definitely be revisiting a lot of my work on Anchor Protocol for some more comprehensive write-ups) so of course I jumped into these two prompts.</p>

<p>The basis of this is my work on these bounties:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://app.flipsidecrypto.com/dashboard/into-the-wormhole-Sqv35x">My submission (101)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://app.flipsidecrypto.com/dashboard/usd-terra-usd-v5wGyB">My submission (103)</a></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note - images are linked to an interactive version of the chart until embeds are fixed. From there, you can download via csv or see the SQL to reproduce and further explore the data. Most charts are from the above bounties, but I did create a few new ones for this post.</em></p>

<p>In this post, I am going to use t$. This is the denomination symbol I am giving to terra dollars and will be using this going forward rather than assuming equivalent value in USD. Basically, it‚Äôs count of UST (because 1=1) plus LUNA (or whatever other token) in UST value. When a chart is scaled to token count, instead, that will be made clear. Basically, t$ means UST.</p>

<p><strong>Very briefly</strong>, what is Wormhole?<br />
It‚Äôs a decentralized, cross-chain, token bridge. Users will find it somewhat similar to the native Terra Bridge, but with support for more chains. That‚Äôs about all I am going to say about it here because Terraform Labs has already written an <a href="https://medium.com/terra-money/wormhole-v2-for-terra-the-ui-walkthrough-595ca6649ae8">extensive blog post</a> on Wormhole. One final note of import is that the eventual plan is for Wormhole to supplant the Bridge due to its decentralized nature.</p>

<p>Access to the <a href="https://wormholebridge.com/">Wormhole Token Bridge</a> kicked-off with that tweet on October 19th and immediately we see some large outflow of UST. Now, this was mainly one single transaction of 30mm, so in reality it took a couple days for user behavior to rev up.<br />
The <a href="https://finder.extraterrestrial.money/mainnet/address/terra1dtzfwgzt8xa70zkm8gqzwz0n4zrqtngdpqejx5">same address</a> sent the next 30mm on October 30th. I almost got pulled into a rabbit hole by trying to figure out who or what that address is, but we‚Äôre talking wormholes, here, not rabbit holes. Maybe later (probably later).</p>

		We set out to analyze the initial activity, right? <br />
		Solana.  <br />
		That's the initial activity. A lot of value was sent over to Solana in the first ~two months since Wormhole v2 support was added to the Terra network. This shouldn't come as a surprise, as the <a href="https://bridge.terra.money/">native Terra bridge</a> already supports Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain and Harmony. Wormhole offers users another way to get to Ethereum and BSC but Solana is the new kid on the block, and Terra users nearly exclusively used Wormhole to get over to Solana. This donut is percent of total outbound value (t$), thru December 3rd. Over that time period, users have send $185.3mm in LUNA and UST, primarily to Solana and Ethereum.<br />

</div>
A significant majority of this outflow has been the stablecoin, UST. This is not wholly surprising for a few reasons. LUNA is the native chain token. It secures the network, it can be bonded, it can be used as collateral ... ultimately, it's most useful on the mother chain (though Terra does need solid LUNA/UST pools across inter-chain networks üåê). UST, on the other hand, is money, let it fly üí∏.
</p>

<p>So, it seems users are pretty excited to have direct access to bridge their UST from Terra over to Solana. Context is always important, so let‚Äôs take a look at just how much UST has been sent to Solana, and how much already exists across the major chains.</p>

		Per the respective block scanners, the supply of wrapped UST (as of this writing) is:

		Finally, I was interested in *who* is sending money through the wormhole. Is it whales, like those $30mm transfers? Or is it the everydayman, just looking for some low-fee yield? Turns out, it's a bit of both. We can look at the spread of transfer size to determine the type of user that's sending money through the wormhole. I did have to set an upper limit at $4mm as the chart scaling skews representation on the smaller end. <a href="https://velocity-app.flipsidecrypto.com/velocity/visuals/0bf8920d-12d1-40b7-bf54-c2726c1523e4/c87a857d-4abd-4fc9-b16c-578e243d0809">Here's an un-capped chart</a>.<br />
		<br />
		I was, frankly, surprised to see the extensive spread of transfers &gt;t$100,000. I can throw some hypothese out there, but a look at LUNA's price action might be lending a helping hand to these large transactions. Today, LUNA recently overtook DOGE as the 10th largest cryptocurrency, by marketcap, and has made quite a lot of people quite a lot of money. However, that's not the point of this writeup, so we'll move on.<br />

<p>Affluent wallets are readily sending their UST through the wormhole. The direct Terra-Solana connection is long awaited, and we can see the immediate impact of the past six weeks. At some point soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, Flipside will announce Solana tables and bounties and all that analytical goodness. Where this UST is going and what users are doing with it is something I‚Äôm incredibly interested in. For now, I expect users will continue to utilize this new chain connection and we‚Äôll see a steady stream of UST exports off the Terra blockchain.<br /></p>
