  <p>This was Thorin’s style. He was an important dwarf. If he had been allowed, he would probably have gone on like this until he was out of breath, without telling any one there anything that was not known already.

  <p>Bilbo knew it. He had read of a good many things he had never seen or done. He was very much alarmed, as well as disgusted; he wished himself a hundred miles away, and yet—and yet somehow he could not go straight back to Thorin and Company emptyhanded.

<blockquote>
  <p>“O!” said Bilbo, and just at that moment he felt more tired than he ever remembered feeling before. He was thinking once again of his comfortable chair before the fire in his favourite sitting-room in his hobbit-hole, and of the kettle singing. Not for the last time!

  <p>Roads go ever ever on,
Over rock and under tree, By caves where never sun has shone,
By streams that never find the sea; Over snow by winter sown,
And through the merry flowers of June, Over grass and over stone,
And under mountains in the moon. Roads go ever ever on
Under cloud and under star, Yet feet that wandering have gone
Turn at last to home afar. Eyes that fire and sword have seen
And horror in the halls of stone Look at last on meadows green
And trees and hills they long have known.
