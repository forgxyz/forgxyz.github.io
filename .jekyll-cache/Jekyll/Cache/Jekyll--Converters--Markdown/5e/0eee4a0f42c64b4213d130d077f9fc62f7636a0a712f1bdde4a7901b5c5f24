I"J<h1 id="learning-french">learning french</h1>

<p>in early 2021, i’ll be going to france for 5-6 months. major problem - i know <strong>zero</strong> french. so, i’ve got duolingo, drops &amp; rosetta stone on deck.</p>

<p><em>there will definitely be errors in the below. idc, i will not use google translate for anything here - simply relying on what i remember from studying… i have experience with spanish and german so there may be accidental crossover</em></p>
