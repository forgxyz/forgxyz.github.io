<h2 id="what-am-i-working-on-now">what am i working on now</h2>

<p><a href="/cs50ai">cs50ai</a> - i started this course in the spring, but tbh it’s hard to commit to extracurriculars during the summer. so, i decided to push it to the fall. as of october 5th, i have begun again.</p>

<p><a href="french">learning french</a> - i hope to spend several months in avignon next winter into spring, yet don’t know the language. the linked page will be some practice writings as i learn.</p>

<h3 id="past-work">past work</h3>

<h4 id="classes">classes</h4>
<p>everything highlighted on this page is due to the work i have done on the below classes. self-directed study is hard, but cs50 has built such a solid foundation that i feel i can learn just about anything. the below links lead to readme pages for each github repository, within which is my course work.</p>

<p><a href="/cs50x">cs50x</a> - the catalyst needed to push my interest forward with a structured course. i had found cs50x back in early 2017. tried it, gave up. the last thing i wanted to do a few months after graduating college was take more classes. so, i waited a year and tried again in 2018. i got stuck on credit.c and looked for help.</p>

<p>searching for an answer to a programming problem set when you’re on your own is a terrible thing. i found answers that involved concepts so far out of reach i didn’t even realize i was confused about the logic and not the implementation. i was also in the midst of finance and accounting courses evenings after work. i gave up. but, i never forgot.</p>

<p>september 2019 rolled around and i gave myself an ultimatum. i <em>thought</em> i wanted to explore cs and learn python but if i started and gave up again, it was clearly not in the cards. i powered through. sure, i got stuck but i learned how to walk away - literally, taking apollo for a walk around the block is the ideal head clearer - and forget what i got stuck on so i could approach the problem from a new direction. taking this course was the best thing i could have done and failing to get thru it twice made victory a bit sweeter.</p>

<p><a href="/cs50w">cs50w</a> - description pending, but taking this gave me the tools to work on expensifly. and, i just had fun taking this course. i’ve liked everything i have done with python so far, but there is just something different about building some step by step where you can actually see the change. web dev is pretty satisfying.</p>

<h4 id="projects">projects</h4>

<p><a href="/">this website</a> - my fun exploration in having a website and public content. written from the ground up and powered by jekyll. hosted on github pages. saved by bootstrap. <a href="website">notes on its progression</a></p>

<p><a href="/expensifly">expensifly</a> - a django webapp for recording my expenses and broad fiancial management. i use google sheets right now and figured i could do better. my aim is to build a portal i can access from my phone for a quick glance at spending &amp; budgeting.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>28 sept 2020:</strong> <a href="https://expensifly.herokuapp.com">it’s up!</a> … it will be a continual work in progress but it’s up! take a look by logging in with un: <strong>testuser</strong> / pw: <strong>banana4g</strong></li>
  <li>plenty of improvements to be made, like adding visualizations, but i am proud</li>
