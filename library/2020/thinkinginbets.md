# thinking in bets
## Annie Duke


- belief structure:
	1. we hear something
	1. we believe it
	1. we verify that
	
- decisions now are bets about the future
- incorporate uncertainty about the future in decision making
- not "are you confident in that" but "how confident are you in that"
	- ok to be wrong
	- challenge yourself to quantify ranges of alternatives
	- our beiefs are not fully accurate. saying i'm 60% sure allows a 40% chance of being wrong
	
- the outcome of a decision != the quality of the decision. like making a bet, making a decision is about the process
- thinking in probabilistic outcomes > binary win/lose mentality
