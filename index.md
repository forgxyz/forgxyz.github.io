# welcome

there won't be much here for a while... [for some thoughts & progression of this site](office/website)  

the week starts on monday. why is sunday the american standard? no one starts their week on sunday.  
yll
i've made great progress on [the webapp i'm building myself](/expensifly). on track to start using it by oct 1 & i'm very happy with that. plan is to pick up cs50ai from the beginning in early october and continue working on the *master plan* for this site. mostly i need to figure out how jekyll is really supposed to work... and also what content i want on this thing. the main purpose is [my work](office) but i don't want to limit it to just a showcase and also don't want to go as far as to start a blog.
