# just some notes while listening

- belief structure:
	1. we hear something
	1. we believe it
	1. we verify that

- decisions now are bets about the future
- incorporate uncertainty about the future in decision making
- not "are you confident in that" but "how confident are you in that"
	- ok to be wrong
	- challenge yourself to quantify ranges of alternatives
	- our beiefs are not fully accurate. saying i'm 60% sure allows a 40% chance of being wrong
