<h4 id="near">NEAR</h4>
<p>After a successful data curation for Harmony, MDAO and NEAR have partnered to chainwalk and curate blockchain data. Starting up now (mid-late January).</p>

<h4 id="mentors-circle-and-workshops">Mentors Circle and Workshops</h4>
<p>Taking a leadership role in designing and running workshops to educate anyone who wants to come and learn. Topics will cover crypto specific tools, like Dune, Flipside, and the Graph as well as granular sessions on languages and the data stack.</p>

<h5 id="harmony">Harmony</h5>
<p>Cleaning data and curating tables <a href="https://github.com/MetricsDAO/harmony_dbt">using dbt</a> for <span><img src="/dev-archive/assets/images/metrics_dao_logo.png" alt="" height="18" width="18" /></span><a href="https://mirror.xyz/0x3138165f8d21d4869dbD406CD8bc8055CAC8fb6E">MetricsDAO</a>.</p>

<p>First up, Harmony’s raw blockchain ⛓ data is being indexed and the core tables have been built for public access via Snowflake’s data marketplace to enable <a href="https://bounty.metricsdao.xyz/bounty-programs/harmony">community bounties and analytics</a>.</p>

<p>Core tables are done, but curated metrics will be built as the data finds more uses in the community.</p>

<h4 id="classes-">classes 📚</h4>
<p>everything highlighted on this page is due to the work i have done on the below classes. self-directed study is hard, but cs50 has built such a solid foundation that i feel i can learn just about anything. the below links lead to readme pages for each github repository, within which is my course work and the details of what the courses taught me.
the words here are more narrative, <strong>the why not the what</strong>.</p>

<p>📍 <a href="/cs50x">cs50x</a> - the catalyst needed to push my interest forward with a structured course. i had found cs50x a bit after colgate. tried it, gave up. the last thing i wanted to do a few months after graduating college was take more classes. so, i shelved it and focused on my new job and figuring out life.</p>

<p>i came back to cs50x as my accounting and finance classes began to wind down. first time i got really stuck was on credit.c and searching for an answer to a programming problem set when you’re on your own is hard. there were a lot of stackoverflow threads that were more stressful than helpful and i psyched myself out, convinced i’d never get it. classes picked up and i was paying for the accounting certificate while cs50 was free, so shelved it again.</p>

<p>september 2019 rolled around and again i had a desire to develop this skillset. i really wanted to know python and wanted to be able build anything i wanted. so i gave myself an ultimatum. if i started and gave up again, it was clearly not in the cards. this time i powered through. sure, i got stuck but i learned how to walk away - literally, taking apollo for a walk around the block is the ideal head clearer - and forget what i got stuck on so i could approach the problem from a new direction. taking this course was the best thing i could have done and failing to get thru it in my past 2 attempts made finishing the course all that much more rewarding.</p>

<p>📍 <a href="/cs50w">cs50w</a> - my covid distraction. april and may were incredibly slow and i used to enjoy trying to write webapps for the ipod touch back in the day. taking this gave me the tools to work on a webapp i had been wanting to build. it’s below as ‘expensifly’. basically, i just had fun taking this course. i’ve liked everything i have done with python so far, but there is just something different about building some step by step where you can actually see the change. web dev is super satisfying, but for me just a hobby.</p>

<p>📍 <a href="/cs50ai">cs50ai</a> - i started this course but my desire to work through it waned as covid wore on and down. might come back at a later date as i did with cs50x, but as of now i do not plan to restart it. leaving on this list for the projects that i did work through. as of spring/summer 2021, i’m giving myself extra time for analysis via flipside.</p>

<h4 id="projects-">projects 🕹</h4>

<p>💸 <a href="/expensifly">expensifly</a> - a django webapp for recording my expenses and broad fiancial management. i use google sheets right now and figured i could do better. my aim is to build a portal i can access from my phone for a quick glance at spending &amp; budgeting.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>28 sept 2020:</strong> <a href="https://expensifly.herokuapp.com">it’s up!</a> … it will be a continual work in progress but it’s up! take a look by logging in with un: <strong>testuser</strong> / pw: <strong>banana4g</strong></li>
  <li>plenty of improvements to be made, like adding visualizations, but i am proud of it</li>
  <li>it’s the free level of heroku, so have some patience on first load if the server went to sleep</li>
</ul>

<p>👨🏼‍💻 <a href="/">this website</a> - my fun exploration in having a website and public content. written from the ground up and powered by jekyll. hosted on github pages. saved by bootstrap. this experience has also helped me publish and manage <a href="https://travelswithmally.com/">mallory’s blog</a> while she is teaching in Avignon!
turns out i’m not really interested in blogging or anything like that, so it’s a portfolio page</p>
