# FROM Clause

The `FROM` clause is used to specify the table or tables that you want to query data from. The `FROM` clause is a required part of the `SELECT` statement, and it must be followed by the name of the table that contains the data you want to retrieve.

The basic syntax of the `FROM` clause is as follows:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```

In the above syntax, `column1`, `column2`, etc. are the names of the columns that you want to retrieve data from, and `table_name` is the name of the table that contains the data.
