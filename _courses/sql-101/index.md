# Welcome to SQL 101

This course will teach you the basics of SQL specifically for use in Blockchain analytics using [Flipside](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz). 

Please note, the content of this course was adapted from something I wrote in 2022 and still needs a bit of polishing. I will update this on a somewhat regular basis, with a focus on how to maximize the use of Flipside's Data Studio. Advandced topics yet to come will focus on Flipside LiveQuery, Utils functions, and more.
